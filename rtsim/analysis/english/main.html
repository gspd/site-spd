At this research line we work in a bunch of projects.
<p>

One of them is concerned with the improvements in a performance prediction
tool aimed to parallel programs. This tool works from the simulation of a 
program's execution graph.
<p>

Other project comes from a collaborative work with Prof. Barton P. Miller's
group, at Wisconsin University - Madison. At this project we are developing
new extensions in Paradyn <http://www.cs.wisc.edu/paradyn>.
<p>

A third project, almost finished, comes from Etore Marcari'e work in the 
establishment of a <a href="../PerfTables/index.html"> database</a> of tools and
techniques for performance analysis of parallel systems.
<p>

A fourth project is concerned with the simulation of concurrent programs. The
goal is to provide a tool capable to simulate concurrent behaviors and also 
to validate concurrent solutions.
