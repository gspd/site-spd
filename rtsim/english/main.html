At this research line we work in a single project. It is concerned with 
the development of a web-based learning tool applied to real-time systems.
<p>

This tool has three different goals. The original goal was to provide 
a simulator for real-time scheduling algorithms. A second goal was to
provide a simulator for real-time oriented Petri nets. The final goal 
is the complete web-based learning tool, that is oriented by learning styles. 
<p>

Most of the work in the first goal has been completed. Now we're working 
on a Java implementation of the scheduling algorithms, which will enable
a higher portability for our tool.
<p>

The second goal is under development by the work of Cristiano Pires Martins,
and a simulator's prototype is already running.
<p>

The third goal is also the most challenging. All the inner modules (control,
communication) are done. We're working on a content uploader in order to 
automate the data insertion procedure.
