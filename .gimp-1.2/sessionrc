# GIMP sessionrc
# This file takes session-specific info (that is info,
# you want to keep between two gimp-sessions). You are
# not supposed to edit it manually, but of course you
# can do. This file will be entirely rewritten every time
# you quit the gimp. If this file isn't found, defaults
# are used.
